# Third Milestone Project / Grubhub
____

Grubhub is a site to showcase my skills in my first Full Stack website. The purpose of the website is to allow a user to access the website to
view and search for recipes. The user will also have the option of registering an account on the website. Once they have done this the user
will then also have access to additional features of the website that allows them to create their own recipes and add them to the site. The 
user will also be able to view their own collection of recipes that they've added to the site and edit or delete them.

## UX Design:

### Strategy

#### Who is this for?
This website is available to any user on the web who wishes to find recipes. The site is also for anyone who wishes to 
create an account in order to build and manage their own collection of recipes. 

#### What type of content will be relevant? 
The content on the site will be made up of a collection of recipes built by the site administrator and the users themselves.

Media content â€“ The recipes will be displayed in a card format. Each card will have an image so the users can easily see what
                recipe they would like to choose.

### Scope

#### What does the client need?
* A brand name to help make the site more recognisable and create a sense of familiarity.
* A mobile first website approach
* A catalogue page displaying any recipes added by users, including a brief outline of what each recipe is.
* A catalogue page for the use to display all of the recipes in their personal collection.
* A registration page
* A login page
* An "Add recipe" page
* An "View recipe" page
* An "Edit recipe" page

#### What else can we provide for the client?
* A news section that will update fans with any new products that are being released, or any new updates or bug fixes for current products
* A contact section to leave feedback about games, or for any potential collaborations with other people or businesses in the industry.

### Structure

#### Information Architecture
For this project I will be using a standard tree structure. To achieve this, the header of each page will 
consist of a navigation bar that contains the logo of the business and the main navigational links for each page in the website.

Information Architecture

For this project I will be using a standard tree structure. To achieve this, the header of each page will

## Testing
In order to ensure the website functioned as expected, all of the testing for this project was done using the browser web developer tools. This was a very 
important tool for me through the creative process as it helped me to isolate where the problems were in my code. The issues that this helped me resolve 
include:

* Test my python application
The very first thing to test in this project was my python application setup.
1. Create a root view that renders a simple <h1> tag with the content "Hello World".
2. Run the application via the terminal.
3. Check to see that the element is rendered.

* Test a template:
The second thing to test in this project was the templates.
1. Create a base template
2. Create an index template containing a <h1> tag with the content "index template"
3. Run the application via the terminal.
4. Check to see that index.html is rendered.

* Connection to the database:
Next I tested the connection to my MongoDB database.
1. Create a sample recipe in the database.
2. Create a function in the index view to return everything from the database.
3. Add the html to return everything from the document into an unordered list
4. Run the application through the terminal and verify that the contents of the document
   are displayed and the connection to the database secure.

* Navigation bar links:
1. Click each link and check to that each page is rendered.

* Registration form - databse connection:
1. Fill out the form and click the submit button to see if I am redirected back to the home page.
2. Check the database to see if the document has been submitted.

* Registration form - empty/partially filled form:
1. Try to submit form with empty fields
2. Partially fill out the form.
3. Try to submit a partially filled form and check for the required field messages.

* Registration form - password field:
1. Start typing
2. Check to see password message is displayed when the user starts typing.
3. Type a password 8 characters long.
4. Check to see the password message disappears.
5. Delete some characters so the password is less than 8 characters long. 
6. Check to see that the password message reappears.
7. Type in a password less than 8 characters.
8. Click out of the password input field.
9. Check to see that the password message remains if the password entered is less than 8 characters.

* Registration form - repeat password field:
1. Start typing a the repeat password.
2. Check to see that the repeat password message appears.
3. Check that the submit button is disabled if the passwords do not match.
3. Type the same password and check to see that the message changes accordingly when the passwords match.
4. Click the submit button to verify that the submit button has been re-enabled.

* Registration form - username field:
1. Type in a username that exists in the database.
2. Fill out the form.
3. Submit the form.
4. Check to see that the flash message is displayed when the user tries to enter a username that already exists.

* Login/ Modal:
1. Create an account.
2. Enter the username of the account in the login form.
3. Enter an invalid password and click login.
4. Check to see that the invalid username/password combination message is flashed.
5. Enter the correct password anf click login to check that I am redirected to the index page.
6. Check for the welcome message in the navbar.


* Layout - mostly padding and margins, to ensure adequate spacing between elements as well as sizing for elements.

* Media queries - certain elements that might overflow such as titles, on very small screen sizes. Viweing the change of elements with screen sizes allowed
  me to make the necessary changes so that elemnts were proportional across differnet screen widths. 

I used a *code validator* on [W3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to checks for any errors that needed to be 
fixed in my code. 

Finally, I posted my project in the peer-code-review channel on Slack and received some very helpful criticism to help me fix some mistakes that 
slipped under the rader.

## Deployment 
1. The project was written and developed in the Gitpod IDE.
2. A local repository was intialized using Git. Regular changes were commited to the local repository.
3. Github was used as a remote repository, and at the end of each development session, all local commits were pushed to ()
4. The projectâ€™s source file was published from GitHub repository to GitHub pages using GitHub default settings via the master branch.
5. GitHub Pages was then enabled to publish the site from the master branch following this path:
.. 1. GitHub repository settings page.
.. 2. Scrolling down to the GitHub Pages Repository box, the master branch was selected from the dropdown menu.
.. 3. The action was saved by clicking the save button.

6. The Projectâ€™s source file is now published as a site on GitHub Pages at [Astirian-Rae Games](https://martycistudent.github.io/First-milestone-project/)

## Credits
### Media 
The full width background image on the index page of the website was taken from a stock image website called [shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/search/food+background) 

### Acknowledgements 
#### Front End
For the main layout of this project I took inspiration from [Jamie Oliver's cooking website](https://www.jamieoliver.com/) and [BBC goodfood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/).
This is also where I found most of the recipes to populate the website. 

#### Back End
To complete this project I relied on additional reasearch in order to get the reistration and login features of the page fully functional.
